                <h1>The Evolution of Data Science: From Spreadsheets to Smart Systems</h1>
                
                <p>There was a time when data science meant writing a few lines of Python, cleaning CSVs, and running some regressions in a Jupyter notebook. Life was simpler — datasets were smaller, models were interpretable, and the tech stack was a lot less intimidating.</p>
                
                <p>But like everything in tech, the field didn't stay still. Over the last decade, data science has evolved from individual analysis to large-scale intelligence engineering, and that shift has completely transformed the tools, skills, and mindset a data scientist needs.</p>
                
                <h2>1. The early days: Excel, R, and intuition</h2>
                
                <p>Back in the late 2000s and early 2010s, the "data scientist" was part statistician, part hacker, part storyteller.
                The job revolved around:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Collecting data (often from messy spreadsheets)</li>
                    <li>Running statistical analyses in R or Python</li>
                    <li>Presenting insights with plots or dashboards</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Most of the time, the hardest part wasn't computation — it was getting clean data and making sense of it. Pipelines were manual, models ran locally, and the term machine learning engineer didn't even exist in most org charts.</p>
                
                <h2>2. Big data changed everything</h2>
                
                <p>Then came Hadoop, Spark, and the explosion of "big data." Suddenly, it wasn't enough to know how to analyze — you had to know how to scale.</p>
                
                <p>This was the rise of distributed computing.
                Data scientists started working with:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>HDFS, Hive, and Presto for large-scale querying</li>
                    <li>PySpark and Scala for distributed processing</li>
                    <li>AWS, Azure, and GCP for storage and compute</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The modern data stack was born — and with it, a new expectation: data scientists needed to understand not just analysis, but data infrastructure.</p>
                
                <h2>3. The modern era: automation, cloud, and MLOps</h2>
                
                <p>Today, data science sits at the intersection of AI engineering, software development, and cloud architecture.</p>
                
                <p>We don't just train models — we deploy, monitor, and integrate them into production systems.
                We work with:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Containers (Docker, Kubernetes)</li>
                    <li>Model orchestration tools (Airflow, MLflow, Kubeflow)</li>
                    <li>Data versioning (DVC, Delta Lake)</li>
                    <li>Vector databases, embeddings, and LLMs</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>And instead of running everything locally, our pipelines live on cloud-native and serverless systems.
                The notebook still exists — but now it's often just the starting point.</p>
                
                <h2>4. The skill shift: from analysts to architects</h2>
                
                <p>The modern data scientist is less of a "model tinkerer" and more of a systems thinker.
                We now need to:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Understand APIs, version control, and CI/CD</li>
                    <li>Build data workflows that interact with real-time services</li>
                    <li>Collaborate closely with data engineers, ML engineers, and software devs</li>
                    <li>Think about scalability, latency, and maintainability</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>In other words, it's not just about insights anymore — it's about integration.</p>
                
                <h2>5. The next phase: AI-native data science</h2>
                
                <p>We're now entering the age of AI-augmented data science. Tools like LangChain, LlamaIndex, and GPT-based agents are reshaping how we query, clean, and interpret data.</p>
                
                <p>The next generation of data scientists won't just use AI — they'll build it, evaluate it, and fine-tune it.
                The stack is shifting again, from Spark and SQL to vector stores, retrieval pipelines, and multi-agent systems.</p>
                
                <p>And yet, despite all this change, the core remains the same: asking good questions, reasoning with data, and communicating clearly.</p>
                
                <h2>6. A field that never stops evolving</h2>
                
                <p>If you're in data science today, you're standing at the intersection of multiple revolutions — software, cloud, and AI.
                The stack will keep changing, but one truth remains constant: curiosity scales better than any framework.</p>
                
                <p>So whether you're debugging a PySpark job, fine-tuning an LLM, or plotting your first seaborn chart — you're part of a lineage that keeps redefining what "data science" means.</p>
